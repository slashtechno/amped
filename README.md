# Amped  
The missing account switcher for Amp 

[Amp](http://ampcode.com/) is a coding agent that, so far, has been one of the most powerful I've used. I have both a work account, which is paid and is part of a Amp team, and a personal free account. Issue is, Amp currently has no way of quickly switching betwen them. Amped is a CLI tool that extracts and stores Amp's API keys, allowing different API keys to be used dependning on what account you need to use.
